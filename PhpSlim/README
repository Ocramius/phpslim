PhpSlim is the PHP port of Robert C. Martin's Slim
(Simple List Invocation Method).

It is written and maintained by Gregor Gramlich.

You need a copy of FitNesse to run the FitNesse wiki.
Download the latest release (use the zip file) from
http://fitnesse.org/FitNesseDevelopment.DownLoad

You also need a working cli installation of php 5.1.2 or higher.
There is no need for a php webserver installation.

For the following instructions, we assume that this Readme
file is under /path/to/PhpSlim on a Linux system.

cd /path/to/PhpSlim
php configure.php

The configure.php script does some small installation checks and
sets up the PhpTests wiki page with your paths.

Then call the FitNesse run.sh / run.bat script from the 
FitNesse zip file like this:

run.sh -p 8070 -d /path/to/PhpSlim

Browse to http://localhost:8070

You may change the port (8070) to your needs.

On Ubuntu machines, you have to replace the first line of the run.sh
script from 
#!/bin/sh
to
#!/bin/bash
